# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
The Bank Customer Churn Prediction project involves analyzing and predicting the likelihood of customers leaving a bank. Using historical customer data, this project applies machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and key indicators that can predict churn. The goal is to enable the bank to proactively retain customers by understanding the factors influencing their decision to leave.

##Objectives:

To develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers at risk of churning.

To analyze key factors contributing to customer churn.

To provide actionable insights and recommendations for customer retention strategies.

##Data:
The dataset typically includes customer information such as:

Demographics: age, gender, marital status, etc
.
Account information: account balance, number of products, tenure, etc.

Transaction details: transaction history, frequency, and amounts.

Customer service interactions: complaints, resolution times, satisfaction scores, etc.

##Steps:

##Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Gather historical data on customer demographics, account details, and transaction history.

Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring consistency.

Perform feature engineering to create new relevant features.

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct descriptive statistics to understand the distribution and trends in the data.

Visualize data through plots and graphs to identify patterns and correlations.

##Feature Selection:

Select important features that have a significant impact on customer churn. 

Use techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, and domain knowledge.

##Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

##Model Evaluation and Selection:

Compare model performance and select the best model based on evaluation metrics.

Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

##Model Deployment:

Implement the selected model into a real-time prediction system.

Integrate the model with the bank’s existing CRM system for continuous monitoring.

##Insights and Recommendations:

Analyze the model’s output to identify the top factors influencing churn.
Provide actionable recommendations for improving customer retention based on insights.

##Conclusion:
The Bank Customer Churn Prediction project is a comprehensive approach to understanding and mitigating customer attrition. Through advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, banks can make informed decisions to keep their customers engaged and satisfied.
